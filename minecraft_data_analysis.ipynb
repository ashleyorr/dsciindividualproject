    "In today’s digital gaming world, understanding how users behave is key to boosting engagement and keeping players around. Many gaming platforms use subscription-based models to make money, so knowing what motivates a user to subscribe can guide effective strategies. In this project, we look at how a player’s experience level and their activity during sessions can affect their chances of subscribing. By carefully processing data, visualizing it, and using predictive modeling with k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), we aim to find important behavior patterns and create a model to predict subscription status.\n",
