    "### Data Collection Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was collected from a free public Minecraft server operated from researchers at the University of British Columbia. The goal of this data collection was to gather behavioral and demographic information of players to better support the development of an AI capable of playing Minecraft.\n",

    "### Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the dataset is high quality and full of insightful information. However, there are some issues with the naming of variables:\n",
    "- Some variables use `snake_case` (e.g., `played_hours`), others use `camelCase` (e.g., `hashedEmail`), and some are inconsistently capitalized (e.g., `Age`).\n",
    "- Overall, these issues are minor and do not actually affect the usability of the dataset."
